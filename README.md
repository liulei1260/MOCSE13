# MOCSE13
We create the dataset MOCSE13 by using Unity to generate synthetic images for 13 different objects (fruits and vegetables). We propose deep model architectures for multi-class object counting and object size estimation. Our proposed models with different backbones are evaluated on the synthetic dataset. The experimental results provide a benchmark for multi-class object counting and size estimation and the synthetic dataset can be served as a proper testbed for future studies.
The dataset MOCSE13 can be download from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8nqyj6ycgr7jltl/AACfmgH7eU-OT4FDrrC9luyma?dl=0
We could create customized data (new type of object) based on the requirements

# Single/multi-class object counting and size estimation
A Pytorch implementation of deep model based approach for single/multi-class object counting and size estimation problems

# How to use
1. Modify the data path and parameter settings as needed
2. Use this command to train and test: python3 single/multi-counting/size.py  
   i.e: python3 multi_channels_size_estination
